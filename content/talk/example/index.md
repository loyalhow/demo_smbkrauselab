abstract: "The atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) is estimated to increase to 550 ppm by 2050. Simultaneously, extreme weather phenomena will increase due to climate change. The effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and weather phenomena such as drought on agricultural crop production have already been studied in detail. However, feedbacks of the corresponding prokaryotic communities in the rhizosphere are less well understood. In this talk Sascha M.B. Krause will talk about the results of A 2-year Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) field experiment. The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (e[CO2]), drought, and different nitrogen fertilizer regimes on rhizospheric prokaryotes were in the focus of this study. Results obtained under field conditions suggest that the bacterial community composition are the most likely microbial parameter to change under future e[CO2] with unknown consequences for microbiological soil functions."
