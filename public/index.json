The only biological way of degrading this potent greenhouse gas is by microbial oxidation. Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (MB) play an important role in many ecosystems worldwide degrading methane before it can escape to the atmosphere. This group of bacteria has intensively been studied as a model microbial functional guild because there is a strong link between the consumption of methane and the composition of MB communities, facilitating the study of microbial “behavior” in the environment. These studies have revealed a strong biogeography of MB which is displayed in their phylogeny not only on the basis of single functional marker genes but also on genome sequence basis. Novel environmental controlling factors have been revealed (e.g. rare earth metals) as well as novel organisms with as yet unknown traits for MB. The resistance and resilience of methane consumption and methane consuming communities have been shown to depend on specific community members. The current knowledge on environmental distribution and of MB has led to propose a life-history scheme, classifying MB communities on their collective traits rather than singly on their capacity the oxidise methane alone.","tags":["Aerobic methanotrophs","Biogeography","Ecology","Traits","Life-history"],"title":"Methanotroph Ecology, Environmental Distribution and Functioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573516800,"objectID":"e65b176877fb8a0ab9b16a09c267ec86","permalink":"https://loyalhow.github.io/post/editorialboardejosb/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/editorialboardejosb/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":["Journal"],"title":"Editorial board member of the European Journal of Soil  Biology (EJSB)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Sascha M.B.

However, little is known about the effect of warming and degradation and their interactions on ecosystem functions like soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and methane (CH4) uptake in this region. Here, we selected a long-term simulated warming site in a Tibetan alpine meadow with different degradation levels. After 4 years of warming, we analyzed soil total C (TC) and total N (TN) contents, extractable organic C (EOC) and extractable organic N (EON) contents as well as methanotrophic activity, abundance and community structure. Soil EOC and EON contents were measured through hot water extraction, whereas methanotrophic activity was measured along a gradient of CH4 concentrations in laboratory incubations. Michaelis–Menten kinetics analysis [maximal rate of velocity (Vmax) and half-saturation constant (Km)] was used to quantify changes in methanotrophic activity among the treatments. Active methanotrophic communities in the natural soils were measured via DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP). The results showed that warming significantly increased soil EON contents, whereas degradation significantly decreased soil TC and TN contents, and EOC and EON contents. Methanotrophic activity was significantly lower at different levels of degradation but no significant effects were observed under warming. Changes in soil methanotrophic abundance among the treatments followed the same trend, but warming and degradation had no interactive effects on methanotrophic activity and abundance. Active methanotrophic communities in the natural meadow soils were dominated by Methylosinus (a Type II methanotroph). In conclusion, our results indicate that soil C and N pools and CH4 oxidation capability were influenced more strongly by degradation than warming. However, warming may have an additional effect on the stability of these important ecosystem processes, regardless of degradation in this region.","tags":["Warming","Degradation","Extractable organic C","Extractable organic N","Methanotrophic activity","Alpine meadow"],"title":"Soil extractable organic C and N contents, methanotrophic activity under warming and degradation in a Tibetan alpine meadow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha M.B.

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","tags":["Synthetic ecology","Eco-physiology","Flow cytometry","Methylobacter","Metabolic transformation"],"title":"Lanthanide-dependent cross-feeding of methane-derived carbon is linked by microbial community interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"\rCheck out the latest news to read what DOE has to say about this research.\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573516800,"objectID":"77d9265a1d195d7a09f8a5dd066811f7","permalink":"https://loyalhow.github.io/post/doe_highlight/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/doe_highlight/","section":"post","summary":"Check out the latest news to read what DOE has to say about this research.","tags":null,"title":"Sascha M.B.

Today’s -omics toolbox allows assessing the genomic potential of microbes in natural environments in a high-throughput fashion and at a strain-level resolution. However, understanding of the details of microbial activities and of the mechanistic bases of community function still requires experimental validation in simplified and fully controlled systems such as synthetic communities. We have studied methane utilization in Lake Washington sediment for a few decades and have identified a number of species genetically equipped for this activity. We have also identified co-occurring satellite species that appear to form functional communities together with the methanotrophs. Here, we compare experimental findings from manipulation of natural communities involved in metabolism of methane in this niche with findings from manipulation of synthetic communities assembled in the laboratory of species originating from the same study site, from very simple (two-species) to rather complex (50-species) synthetic communities. We observe some common trends in community dynamics between the two types of communities, toward representation of specific functional guilds. However, we also identify strong discrepancies between the dominant methane oxidizers in synthetic communities compared to natural communities, under similar incubation conditions. These findings highlight the challenges that exist in using the synthetic community approach to modeling dynamics and species interactions in natural communities.","tags":["Synthetic community","Methylotrophy","Methanotroph","Methylobacter","Methylosarcina","Methylomonas","Lake Washington"],"title":"A Synthetic Ecology Perspective: How Well Does Behavior of Model Organisms in the Laboratory Predict Microbial Activities in Natural Habitats?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Ho","Erik van den Brink","Andreas Reim","Sascha M.B.

Desiccation-rewetting events alter the soil quality and nutrient concentrations which drive microbial-mediated processes, including methane oxidation, a key biogeochemical process catalyzed by methanotrophic bacteria. Although aerobic methanotrophs showed remarkable resilience to a suite of physical disturbances induced as a single event, their resilience to recurring disturbances is less known. Here, using a rice field soil in a microcosm study, we determined whether recurrence and frequency of desiccation-rewetting impose an accumulating effect on the methanotrophic activity. The response of key aerobic methanotroph subgroups (type Ia, Ib, and II) were monitored using qPCR assays, and was supported by a t-RFLP analysis. The methanotrophic activity was resilient to recurring desiccation-rewetting, but increasing the frequency of the disturbance by twofold significantly decreased methane uptake rate. Both the qPCR and t-RFLP analyses were congruent, showing the dominance of type Ia/Ib methanotrophs prior to disturbance, and after disturbance, the recovering community was predominantly comprised of type Ia (Methylobacter) methanotrophs. Both type Ib and type II (Methylosinus/Methylocystis) methanotrophs were adversely affected by the disturbance, but type II methanotrophs showed recovery over time, indicating relatively higher resilience to the disturbance. This revealed distinct, yet unrecognized traits among the methanotroph community members. Our results show that recurring desiccation-rewetting before a recovery in community abundance had an accumulated effect, compromising methanotrophic activity. While methanotrophs may recover well following sporadic disturbances, their resilience may reach a ‘tipping point’ where activity no longer recovered if disturbance persists and increase in frequency.","tags":["Recurring disturbance","pmoA","Methane oxidation","Functional traits","Resilience"],"title":"Recurrence and Frequency of Disturbance have Cumulative Effect on Methanotrophic Activity, Abundance, and Community Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha M.B.

Results show that the methanotrophic diversity was similar between drained and rewetted sites with a remarkable dominance of the genus Methylocystis.

Short-term flooding led to temporary elevated CH4 emission but to neither major changes in abundances of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) nor major changes in CH4 consumption kinetics in drained agriculturally used peat meadows. Radiolabeling and autoradiographic imaging of intact soil cores revealed a markedly different spatial arrangement of the CH4 consuming zone in cores exposed to near-atmospheric and elevated CH4. The observed spatial patterns of CH4 consumption in drained peat meadows with and without short-term flooding highlighted the spatial complexity and responsiveness of the CH4 consuming zone upon environmental change. The methanotrophic microbial community is not generally altered and harbors MOB that can cover a large range of CH4 concentrations offered due to water-table fluctuations, effectively mitigating CH4 emissions.","tags":["Restoration","14C labelling","Atmospheric CH4","Spatial micro-distribution","Peat land","Pyrosequencing"],"title":"Compositional and functional stability of aerobic methane consuming communities in drained and rewetted peat meadows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha M.B.

This shift offers opportunities for a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes and services. In this paper, we highlight studies that have focused on BEF of microbial communities with an emphasis on integrating trait-based approaches to microbial ecology. In doing so, we explore some of the inherent challenges and opportunities of understanding BEF using microbial systems. For example, microbial biologists characterize communities using gene phylogenies that are often unable to resolve functional traits. Additionally, experimental designs of existing microbial BEF studies are often inadequate to unravel BEF relationships. We argue that combining eco-physiological studies with contemporary molecular tools in a trait-based framework can reinforce our ability to link microbial diversity to ecosystem processes. We conclude that such trait-based approaches are a promising framework to increase the understanding of microbial BEF relationships and thus generating systematic principles in microbial ecology and more generally ecology.","tags":["Functional traits","Ecosystem function","Ecological theory","Study designs","Microbial diversity"],"title":"Trait-based approaches for understanding microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha M.B.

However, for microorganisms, this may not be true given that they display high physiological flexibility and have fast regeneration. This may result in fundamentally different patterns of resemblance, that is, in variable strength of phylogenetic signal. However, in microbiological inferences, trait similarities and therewith microbial interactions with its environment are mostly assumed to follow evolutionary relatedness. Here, we tested whether indeed a straightforward relationship between relatedness and physiological traits exists for aerobic methane‐oxidizing bacteria (MOB). We generated a comprehensive data set that included 30 MOB strains with quantitative physiological trait information. Phylogenetic trees were built from the 16S rRNA gene, a common phylogenetic marker, and the pmoA gene which encodes a subunit of the key enzyme involved in the first step of methane oxidation. We used a Blomberg's K from comparative biology to quantify the strength of phylogenetic signal of physiological traits. Phylogenetic signal was strongest for physiological traits associated with optimal growth pH and temperature indicating that adaptations to habitat are very strongly conserved in MOB. However, those physiological traits that are associated with kinetics of methane oxidation had only weak phylogenetic signals and were more pronounced with the pmoA than with the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny. In conclusion, our results give evidence that approaches based solely on taxonomical information will not yield further advancement on microbial eco‐evolutionary interactions with its environment. This is a novel insight on the connection between function and phylogeny within microbes and adds new understanding on the evolution of physiological traits across microbes, plants and animals.","tags":["Horizontal gene transfer","Methane oxidation","Microorganisms","Modelling","Phylogenomics traits"],"title":"Weak phylogenetic signal in physiological traits of methane‐oxidizing bacteria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha M.B.

We applied a pmoA‐specific microarray to detect MOB, measured methane oxidation, methane emissions and soil properties. All variables were measured in a 10 × 10 m, 1 × 1 m and 20 × 20 cm plot and interpreted using a geostatistical approach. Methane oxidation as well as MOB displayed spatial patterns reflected in the underlying flooding gradient. Overlapping and contrasting spatial patterns for type I and type II MOB suggested different ecological life strategies. With smaller plot size, the environmental gradient could not explain the variability in the data and local factors became more important. In conclusion, environmental gradients can generally explain variability in microbial spatial patterns; however, we think that this does not contribute to a mechanistic explanation for microbial diversity because the relevant scales for microorganisms are much smaller than those normally measured.","tags":["Methane‐oxidizing bacteria","Methane oxidation","Geostatistics","pmoA diagnostic microarray","Scale","Biogeography"],"title":"Spatial patterns of methanotrophic communities along a hydrological gradient in a riparian wetland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Ho","Frederiek‐Maarten Kerckhof","Claudia Luke","Andreas Reim","Sascha M.B.

MOB subgroups have different responses to key environmental controls, reflecting on their functional traits. Their unique features (C1‐metabolism, unique lipids and congruence between the 16S rRNA and pmoA gene phylogeny) have facilitated numerous environmental studies, which in combination with the availability of cultured representatives, yield the most comprehensive ecological picture of any known microbial functional guild. Here, we focus on the broad MOB subgroups (type I and type II MOB), and aim to conceptualize MOB functional traits and observational characteristics derived primarily from these environmental studies to be interpreted as microbial life strategies. We focus on the functional traits, and the conditions under which these traits will render different MOB subgroups a selective advantage. We hypothesize that type I and type II MOB generally have distinct life strategies, enabling them to predominate under different conditions and maintain functionality. The ecological characteristics implicated in their adopted life strategies are discussed, and incorporated into the Competitor‐Stress tolerator‐Ruderal functional classification framework as put forward for plant communities. In this context, type I MOB can broadly be classified as competitor‐ruderal while type II MOB fit more within the stress tolerator categories. Finally, we provide an outlook on MOB applications by exemplifying two approaches where their inferred life strategies could be exploited thereby, putting MOB into the context of microbial resource management.","tags":["Functional traits","Methane oxidzing bacteria","Model system","Ecological theory"],"title":"Conceptualizing functional traits and ecological characteristics of methane‐oxidizing bacteria as life strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Reim","Claudia Lüke","Sascha M.B.

Using microcosms and cryosectioning, we sub-sampled the top 3-mm of a water-saturated soil at near in situ conditions in 100-μm steps. We assessed the community structure and activity using the particulate methane monooxygenase gene pmoA as a functional and phylogenetic marker by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP), a pmoA-specific diagnostic microarray, and cloning and sequencing. pmoA genes and transcripts were quantified using competitive reverse transcriptase PCR combined with t-RFLP. Only a subset of the methanotroph community was active. Oxygen microprofiles showed that 89% of total respiration was confined to a 0.67-mm-thick zone immediately above the oxic–anoxic interface, most probably driven by methane oxidation. In this zone, a Methylobacter-affiliated OTU was highly active with up to 18 pmoA transcripts per cell and seemed to be adapted to oxygen and methane concentrations in the micromolar range. Analysis of transcripts with a pmoA-specific microarray found a Methylosarcina-affiliated OTU associated with the surface zone. High oxygen but only nanomolar methane concentrations at the surface suggested an adaptation of this OTU to oligotrophic conditions. No transcripts of type II methanotrophs (Methylosinus, Methylocystis) were found, which indicated that this group was represented by resting stages only. Hence, different OTUs within a single guild shared the same microenvironment and exploited different niches.","tags":["Methane-oxidizing bacteria","Paddy soil","Microarray","Competitive PCR","pmoA","mmoX"],"title":"One millimetre makes the difference: high-resolution analysis of methane-oxidizing bacteria and their specific activity at the oxic–anoxic interface in a flooded paddy soil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juanjuan Wang","Sascha M.B.

Recently, we developed PCR–DGGE and qPCR assays to detect and enumerate Gallionella-related neutrophilic iron-oxidizers (Ga-FeOB) enabling the assessment of controlling physical as well as biological factors in various ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of Ga-FeOB in co-occurrence with methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) in a riparian wetland. Soil samples were collected at different spatial scales (ranging from meters to centimeters) representing a hydrological gradient. The diversity of Ga-FeOB was assessed using PCR–DGGE and the abundance of both Ga-FeOB and MOB by qPCR. Geostatistical methods were applied to visualize the spatial distribution of both groups. Spatial distribution as well as abundance of Ga-FeOB and MOB was clearly correlated to the hydrological gradient as expressed in moisture content of the soil. Ga-FeOB outnumbered the MOB subgroups suggesting their competitiveness or the prevalence of Fe2+ over CH4 oxidation in this floodplain.","tags":["Gallionella","Iron oxidation","Methane oxidation","Spatial patterns","Geostatistics","Riparian","Wetland"],"title":"Spatial patterns of iron- and methane-oxidizing bacterial communities in an irregularly flooded, riparian wetland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha M.B.

Recent work indicates that microbial communities and microbial processes can be very sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances. However, to what extent microbial communities may change upon, resist to, or overcome disturbances might differ depending on substrate availability. We used soil from an Italian rice field in gradient microcosms, and analysed the response of methanotrophic communities to an NH4+ pulse as a potential disturbance under two different CH4 source strengths. We found a significant influence of source strength, i.e. the energy flow through the methanotrophic community, while NH4+ had no effect. Our data suggest that historical contingencies, i.e. nitrogen fertilization, led to an ammonium‐tolerant MOB community. Methanotrophs were able to oxidize virtually all CH4 diffusing into the oxic–anoxic boundary layer regardless of NH4+ addition. Total and active methanotrophic communities were assessed by a pmoA‐specific microarray. From the reservoir of dormant methanotrophs, different species became active with Methylobacter and an environmental cluster affiliated with paddy soils being indicative for high CH4 source strength. Thus, a microbial seed bank is an important prerequisite to maintain functioning in a fluctuating environment.","tags":["Methane","Model system","Energy flow"],"title":"Methane source strength and energy flow shape methanotrophic communities in oxygen–methane counter‐gradient","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Henri M.P.

Hitherto, spatial heterogeneity and the effects it has on functioning and diversity of methanotrophs in littoral wetlands have been poorly understood. A diagnostic microarray based on the particulate methane monooxygenase gene coupled with geostatistics was used to analyse spatial patterns of methanotrophs in the littoral wetland of a eutrophic boreal lake (Lake Kevätön, Eastern Finland). The wetland had a hydrology gradient with a mean water table varying from −8 to −25 cm. The wettest area, comprising the highest CH4 oxidation, had the highest abundance and species richness of methanotrophs. A high water table favoured the occurrence of type Ib methanotrophs, whereas types Ia and II were found under all moisture conditions. Thus the spatial heterogeneity in functioning and diversity of methanotrophs in littoral wetlands is highly dependent on the water table, which in turn varies spatially in relation to the geomorphology of the wetland. We suggest that changes in water levels resulting from regulation of lakes and/or global change will affect the abundance, activity and diversity of methanotrophs, and consequently CH4 emissions from such systems.","tags":["Littoral wetland","methane emission","Methane oxidation","Methanotrophs"],"title":"Hydrology is reflected in the functioning and community composition of methanotrophs in the littoral wetland of a boreal lake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yao Pan","Levente Bodrossy","Peter Frenzel","Anne-Grethe Hestnes","Sascha M.B.

The aim of this study was to assess inter- as well as intralaboratory variations in microbial community composition when standardized protocols are applied to a single soil sample. Aliquots from a homogenized soil sample from a rice field in Italy were sent to five participating laboratories. DNA was extracted by two investigators per laboratory using an identical protocol. All DNA samples were sent to one laboratory to perform DNA quantification, quantitative PCR (QPCR), and microarray and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses of methanotrophic communities. Yields, as well as purity of DNA, were significantly different between laboratories but in some cases also between investigators within the same laboratory. The differences in yield and quality of the extracted DNA were reflected in QPCR, microarray, and DGGE analysis results. Diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener, evenness, and richness) differed significantly between laboratories. The observed differences have implications for every project in which microbial communities are compared in different habitats, even if assessed within the same laboratory. To be able to make sensible comparisons leading to valid conclusions, intralaboratory variation should be assessed. Standardization of DNA extraction protocols and possible use of internal standards in interlaboratory comparisons may help in rendering a “quantifiable” bias.","tags":["Microbial communities","Methanotrophs","Laboratory variation","Scientific standards","Alpine meadow"],"title":"Impacts of Inter- and Intralaboratory Variations on the Reproducibility of Microbial Community Analyses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha M.B.

However, the ultimate causes for this intersexual niche segregation remain poorly understood. It has been suggested that sexual dimorphism is a consequence of dimorphic niches based upon different reproductive costs and activities of the sexes. Here we provide evidence from field data to examine this hypothesis by studying the behavioral background of niche segregation in Tetrix ceperoi. Our data revealed distinct sexual differences in the substrates on which the insects perched and in the solar radiation of these locations. Males were found at brighter locations and more often on bare ground than females. Incorporation of behavioral data in our analysis showed that patches of bare ground were mainly utilized during mating behavior, in which males invested more time than females. In contrast, females spent more time resting and feeding in the vegetation. Intersexual differences in the proportion of autotomized individuals indicate that males might suffer higher predation risks. These patterns support the dimorphic niches hypothesis, which suggests that differential habitat utilization is caused by differences in the life history strategies of males and females, since males should accept a higher predation risk due to the benefits of multiple matings. Females should invest more time in gaining nutrients and energy for egg production and survival, whereas males should spend more time with searching for mates. We suggest that behavioral covariates should more often be implemented in ecological analyses, since these might have a strong explanatory power.","tags":["Sexual dimorphism","Microhabitat choice","Intersexual competition","Habitat preferences","Sexual selection"],"title":"Intersexual niche segregation in Cepero’s Ground-hopper, Tetrix ceperoi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia Gröning","Sascha M.B.

In Central Europe, the endangered Cepero's ground‐hopper, Tetrix ceperoi, is believed to have its only remaining natural habitats in dune slacks of the Wadden Sea Islands. Our results suggest that this species performs an active habitat choice of damp, bare patches with high temperatures. While ponds and fens in dune slacks provide large areas of damp bare ground and algal mats, grasslands, degraded dune slacks and the transitional zone between salt marsh and dunes are less suited as habitats. The major threat for T. ceperoi is found in the succession of its pioneer habitats due to the reduced natural dynamics. In industrialized countries, pioneer habitats and species are threatened substantially by coastal protection and floodplain regulation. This is only compensated in part by anthropogenic creation of secondary habitats, such as different kinds of pits or coal heaps.
